# RAG AI-Agent Master Deployment Checklist

## Quick Start - Automated Validation

**ðŸš€ RECOMMENDED: Use the automated validation tools!**

### Option 1: Interactive Pre-Flight Checklist (Recommended for first-time users)
```bash
# Interactive checklist with auto-checking
python scripts/pre_flight_checklist.py --auto-check --save-progress
```

### Option 2: Master Validation Script (Recommended for experienced users)
```bash
# Run comprehensive pre-deployment validation
python scripts/master_deployment_validator.py

# Generate detailed report
python scripts/master_deployment_validator.py --generate-report --verbose

# Use config file for API keys (optional)
python scripts/master_deployment_validator.py --config scripts/config.json
```

### Option 3: Post-Deployment Success Reporting
```bash
# After deployment, verify everything is working
python scripts/deployment_success_reporter.py --backend-url YOUR_BACKEND_URL --frontend-url YOUR_FRONTEND_URL
```

These scripts will automatically check all items below and provide deployment readiness assessment.

## Final Validation

### Master Validation Script Results
- [ ] Environment validation: PASSED
- [ ] API connectivity validation: PASSED
- [ ] Pinecone setup validation: PASSED
- [ ] Deployment files validation: PASSED
- [ ] Network connectivity validation: PASSED
- [ ] Overall deployment readiness: READY âœ…

### Manual Verification (if automated validation unavailable)
- [ ] Run: `python scripts/validate_environment.py`
- [ ] Run: `python scripts/validate_api_keys.py`
- [ ] Run: `python scripts/validate_pinecone.py`
- [ ] All validation scripts return success

## Success Criteria

Deployment is considered successful when:
- [ ] **Master validation script reports "DEPLOYMENT READY"**
- [ ] All critical checklist items above are completed
- [ ] Application is accessible to end users
- [ ] All core features are working correctly
- [ ] Performance meets acceptable standards
- [ ] Security measures are properly implemented
- [ ] Post-deployment tests pass successfully

## Automated Deployment (Recommended)

Once validation passes, use automated deployment scripts:

```bash
# Deploy backend to Hugging Face Spaces
python scripts/deploy_backend.py

# Deploy frontend to Vercel (after updating backend URL)
python scripts/deploy_frontend.py

# Run post-deployment tests
python scripts/run_post_deployment_tests.py
```
