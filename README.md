# RAG AI-Agent

RAG AI-Agent is a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation AI assistant that combines the capabilities of large language models with document-based knowledge retrieval. This application allows users to have conversational interactions with their documents by uploading files (PDF, TXT, DOCX), which are then semantically parsed, indexed, and made available for natural language queries.

The project consists of two main parts: a Python FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend.

## Features

*   **Document Processing**: Upload PDF, TXT, and DOCX documents to provide context for the AI.
*   **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in natural language, and the AI will use uploaded documents for accurate, context-aware responses.
*   **Agent Modes**:
    *   **Simple Mode**: Provides direct answers.
    *   **Agent Mode**: Offers advanced reasoning with detailed, step-by-step explanations of the AI's thought process, utilizing tools like a calculator and current time.
*   **Conversation Management**: Easily create new chats, rename them, or delete old ones using intuitive sidebar controls.
*   **Groq Integration**: Configured to use Groq API for fast inference.
*   **Developer Information**: Updated developer contact and social media links.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the RAG AI-Agent locally.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   Node.js and npm (or yarn)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DashMav/AgenticRAG.git
cd AgenticRAG
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Python FastAPI)

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
    # source venv/bin/activate # On macOS/Linux
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Set Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project (`RAG-AI-Agent/`) and add your Groq API key:
    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
    ```
    Replace `"your_groq_api_key_here"` with your actual Groq API key.

3.  **Run the Backend Server**:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app:app --reload
    ```
    The backend server will run on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup (React.js with Vite)

1.  **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd agent-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Environment Variables for Frontend**:
    Create a `.env` file in the `agent-frontend/` directory and set the API URL:
    ```
    VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
    ```

4.  **Run the Frontend Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend application will typically run on `http://localhost:5174`.

### 4. Usage

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5174`.
2.  Start a new conversation, upload documents, or ask questions to the AI agent.
3.  Explore the "About Developer" section for more information about the creator.

## Deployment

This project is designed for a modern, serverless deployment using Vercel for the frontend and Hugging Face Spaces for the backend, with Pinecone for the vector database. This setup is completely free and does not require a credit card.

### 1. Pinecone Setup (Vector Database)

1.  **Create a Pinecone Account**: Go to [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) and sign up for a free account.
2.  **Create an Index**:
    *   In the Pinecone dashboard, create a new index.
    *   Set the **Index Name** to `rag-ai-agent` (or a name of your choice).
    *   Set the **Dimension** to `1536` (this is the dimension for OpenAI's embeddings).
    *   Choose a free pod type.
3.  **Get API Key**:
    *   In the Pinecone dashboard, go to "API Keys" and copy your API key.

### 2. Backend Deployment (Hugging Face Spaces)

1.  **Create a Hugging Face Account**: If you don't have one, sign up at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).
2.  **Create a New Space**:
    *   Go to your Hugging Face profile and click on "New Space".
    *   Select "Docker" as the Space SDK.
    *   Choose a name for your space.
    *   In the "Secrets" section, add the following secrets:
        *   `GROQ_API_KEY`: Your Groq API key.
        *   `PINECONE_API_KEY`: Your Pinecone API key.
        *   `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`: The name of your Pinecone index (e.g., `rag-ai-agent`).
        *   `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (required for embeddings).
3.  **Push Your Code**:
    *   Hugging Face will provide you with Git commands to push your repository to the Space.
    *   Once you push your code, Hugging Face will build the Docker image and deploy your backend.
    *   You will get a public URL for your backend (e.g., `https://your-space-name.hf.space`).

### 3. Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

1.  **Update the `vercel.json` file**:
    *   In `agent-frontend/vercel.json`, replace `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com` with the actual URL of your deployed backend from Hugging Face Spaces.

2.  **Push the updated `vercel.json` to your GitHub repository.**

3.  **Deploy to Vercel**:
    *   Go to the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/new).
    *   Import your GitHub repository.
    *   Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Vite project.
    *   Set the **Root Directory** to `agent-frontend`.
    *   Deploy the project.

Vercel will build and deploy your frontend, and the rewrite rule in `vercel.json` will proxy API requests to your backend on Hugging Face Spaces.
